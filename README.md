# Portfolio

## Description
The motivation for this project was to build a responsive website through CSS and HTML. This project was built for the purpose of understanding containers and CSS styling. I learned a lot of interesting ways to style webpages. It looks a little different than the mockup but i tried my best.

## Usage
